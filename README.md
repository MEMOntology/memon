# memon ontology
The Modular Environmental Monitoring Ontology (MEMOn) is a domain ontology built as a promising solution for the semantic interoperability between resources (human, data, software) in environmental monitoring domain. This ontology will support data integration, data linking and semantic interoperability between heterogeneous data collected throw a variety of observation techniques, different monitoring systems and stored in diverse formats and sometimes in distinctive protocols.

MEMOn currently deals with 'disasters', 'environmental processes', geospatial context particularly 'geospatial locations' and 'environmental features', temporal context. It also handles 'environmental materials' like soil, water, and so on. MEMOn also deals with observation and measurement, sensing information
